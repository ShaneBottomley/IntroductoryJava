Introductory Programming (Java)

## About
These are short programs I wrote in Java during my Introductory Programming class. The course follows along with the interactive Revel textbook Introduction to Java Programming by Daniel Liang. The exercise description I was given will be listed in a exercises.txt file in each weeks folder.

## Learning Breakdown
Week 1:
Introduction to Computers. We learned about CPU, memory, storage, and bits and bytes. I was pretty familiar with these from my CompTIA A+ certificate. We also 

Week 2:
Covered

Week 3:
Implemented boolean expressions and if statements.

Week 4:
Took a leap forward with learning about functions and function calls. Defined my own function and used built in functions.

Week 5:
This week I learned about loops and the while statement. Student grades iterates through a list of students and asks for grades for each. It then returns the name of the student with the highest weighted grade.

Week 6:
I learned about working with strings, such as traversing through a string and string slicing and counting. The "PassCheck" program iterates through a "password" input by the user and ensures it meets the complexity requirements.

Week 7:
We covered traversing, slicing, and operating on arrays. The "Road Trip" program takes information from the user about a road trip, adds it to multiple arrays and then does computatations on the array.

Week 8:
In my "Final Project" I added onto the cleaning program from week 3 & 4. I learned more about validating user input and adding more functions to work together.

Outcome:
Overall, this course was good introduction to Python. There are still a few things I feel I am missing like proper ways of validating user input. Also we did not touch on classes at all, but I have familiarized myself with the concepts using materials from outside the course. I look forward to my next course "Introduction to Programming"
