## Project Title
Introductory Programming (Java)

## About
These are short programs I wrote in Java during my Introductory Programming class. The course follows along with the interactive Revel textbook Introduction to Java Programming by Daniel Liang.

## Learning Breakdown
Week 1:
Introduction to Computers. We learned about CPU, memory, storage, and bits and bytes. I was pretty familiar with these from my CompTIA A+ certificate. We also went over installing the Java SDK and creating our first Java program.

Week 2:
Covered user input using the Scanner class, storing data in variable, using operators, and the basic software development process.

Week 3:
Implemented boolean expressions, if, if else, nested if and multiway if statements. Used switch statements and combination operators (!, &&, ||).

Week 4:
Covered using the Math class to solve problems, String objects, and the Character class.


Week 5:
While loops, do-while loops, and for loops. Pretty similar to Python, just with different syntax. 

Week 6:
We learned about methods in week 6. This was fun to learn. I found it odd you had to specify the return type, but I guess that's Java!

Week 7:
This week we covered single and multidimensional arrays. Multidimensional arrays were a bit challenging to work with, but just thinking of it as a grid of column and rows helped me a lot. 

Week 8:
We're learning about objects and classes. Finally I can start to understand what all these dot notations actually mean! Seems pretty cool and powerful. I am looking forward to building more in depth programs in my next class Intermediate Programming!

Outcome:
Overall, I had fun learning Java. It seems like a bit more complex than Python, but I also have heard that there is plenty of systems out there running on Java and it's a great first language to learn. One thing I will work on is leaving better comments in my code. I did a poor job on that in these programs will do better from now on!
