(Geometry: point in a rectangle?)
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a point (x, y) and checks whether the point is within the rectangle centered at (0, 0) with width 10 and height 5.
For example, (2, 2) is inside the rectangle and (6, 4) is outside the rectangle.
(Hint: A point is in the rectangle if its horizontal distance to (0, 0) is less than or equal to10 / 2 and its vertical distance to (0, 0) is less than or equal to 5.0 / 2. Test your program to cover all cases.)
